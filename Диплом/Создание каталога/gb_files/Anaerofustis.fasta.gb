COMMENT     Anaerofustis stercorihominis (GenBank Accession Number for 16S rDNA
            gene: AJ518871) is a member of the Firmicutes division of the
            domain bacteria and has been isolated from human feces. The
            sequenced strain was obtained from Deutsche Sammlung von
            Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (DSMZ) (DSM 17244).
            
            We have collected 11.1X coverage in plasmid end reads and 454
            reads. We have performed one round of automated sequence
            improvement(pre-finishing), along with manual improvement that
            includes breaking apart any mis-assembly, and making manual joins
            where possible. Manual edits also are made where the consensus
            appears to be incorrect. All low quality data on the ends of
            contigs is removed. Contigs are ordered and oriented where
            possible.
            
            Sequencing/Assembly: The genomic DNA was purified from liquid
            culture derived from a single bacterial colony. A hybrid sequencing
            strategy that utilized reads from both 454 GS-20 and ABI 3730xl
            sequencers was devised and implemented to generate the draft genome
            sequences. 454 reads were assembled using Newbler (454 Life
            Sciences) into 454 de novo contigs. These de novo contigs were
            converted in silico to 800 base paired reads ('superreads') with
            400 base overlaps with neighboring superreads. Finally, PCAP
            (Huang, et al, Genome Research, 13:2164, (2003)) was used to
            assemble the super-reads and the conventional 3730xl capillary
            reads.
            
            This sequenced strain is part of a comprehensive, sequence-based
            survey of members of the normal human gutmicrobiota. A joint effort
            of the WU-GSC and the Center for Genome Sciences at Washington
            University School of Medicine, the purpose of this survey is to
            provide the general scientific community with a broad view of the
            gene content of 100 representatives of the major divisions
            represented in the intestine's microbial community. This
            information should provide a frame of reference for analyzing
            metagenomic studies of the human gut microbiome. Further details of
            this effort are described in a white paper entitled 'Extending Our
            View of Self: the Human Gut Microbiome Initiative (HGMI)'
            (http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/Sequencing/SeqProposals/HGMIS
            eq.pdf).
            
            Coding sequences were predicted using GeneMark v3.3 and Glimmer2
            v2.13. Intergenic regions not spanned by GeneMark and Glimmer2 were
            blasted against NCBI's non-redundant (NR) database and predictions
            generated based on protein alignments. tRNA genes were determined
            using tRNAscan-SE 1.23 and non-coding RNA genes by RNAmmer-1.2 and
            Rfam v8.0. Gene names are generated at the contig level and may not
            necessarily reflect any known order or orientation between contigs.
            These studies are supported by National Human Genome Research
            Institute.

            Annotation was added to the contigs in March 2008

COMMENT     Anaerofustis stercorihominis (GenBank Accession Number for 16S rDNA
            gene: AJ518871) is a member of the Firmicutes division of the
            domain bacteria and has been isolated from human feces. The
            sequenced strain was obtained from Deutsche Sammlung von
            Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (DSMZ) (DSM 17244).
            
            We have collected 11.1X coverage in plasmid end reads and 454
            reads. We have performed one round of automated sequence
            improvement(pre-finishing), along with manual improvement that
            includes breaking apart any mis-assembly, and making manual joins
            where possible. Manual edits also are made where the consensus
            appears to be incorrect. All low quality data on the ends of
            contigs is removed. Contigs are ordered and oriented where
            possible.
            
            Sequencing/Assembly: The genomic DNA was purified from liquid
            culture derived from a single bacterial colony. A hybrid sequencing
            strategy that utilized reads from both 454 GS-20 and ABI 3730xl
            sequencers was devised and implemented to generate the draft genome
            sequences. 454 reads were assembled using Newbler (454 Life
            Sciences) into 454 de novo contigs. These de novo contigs were
            converted in silico to 800 base paired reads ('superreads') with
